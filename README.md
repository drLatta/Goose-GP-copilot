⚠️ Data Privacy and Responsible Use

Goose is designed to support documentation, summarization, and workflow — not to store or process patient-identifiable information.

To use Goose responsibly:

Always use temporary chats or incognito sessions to ensure no long-term memory or retention of patient data.

Never include names, NHIs, dates of birth, contact details, or identifiable features unless you are in a secure, offline environment.

Prefer using de-identified text, or use Goose’s c/ command to sanitize clinical notes before sharing or discussing.

Always review, edit, and confirm AI-generated outputs before entering them into a patient’s clinical record.


Goose does not store or access patient records. It functions as a temporary, session-based copilot, designed to be safe, fast, and compliant when used within standard medical privacy guidelines.
