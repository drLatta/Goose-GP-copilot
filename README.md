## ðŸ§  What is Goose?

**Goose** is a modular prompt-based clinical copilot built on GPT.  
It was designed by a practicing GP to reduce cognitive load, streamline admin chaos, and support decision-making in real-world general practice.

It currently powers 90% of the creatorâ€™s clinical documentation and admin.
