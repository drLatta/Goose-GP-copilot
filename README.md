## üß† What is Goose?

**Goose** is a modular prompt-based clinical copilot built on GPT.  
It was designed by a practicing GP to reduce cognitive load, streamline admin chaos, and support decision-making in real-world general practice.

It currently powers 90% of the creator‚Äôs clinical documentation and admin.

## üöÄ What It Does

Goose uses a command system to handle:

- Clinical note optimization (`o/`)
- Short + long note summaries (`s/`)
- Patient-friendly emails (`e/`)
- Clean, clear referral letters (`r/`)
- De-identified text for case discussions (`c/`)
- Suicide risk stratification via PHQ-9 + C-SSRS (`sr/`)
- Live guideline validation against BPAC/HealthPathways (`g/`)
- Structured export for long-term case storage (`x/`)
- Modular prompt updates (`u/`)

## üì¶ How to Use It

1. Open ChatGPT (or any GPT-4 model)  
2. Paste in the [full Goose 2.6 prompt](./Goose_2.6_Clinical_AI_Copilot.md)  
3. Start your command with:  
   - `o/:` to optimize a note  
   - `s/:` to summarize it  
   - `e/:` to draft a patient email  
   - etc.

### Example:

o/:
Male, 48, came in with shoulder pain. Old sports injury, now worse after lifting. No red flags.

Goose will return a clean, structured note in SOAP format with key actions bolded and spacing optimized for readability.
