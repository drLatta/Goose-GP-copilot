‚ö†Ô∏è Data Privacy and Responsible Use

Goose is designed to support documentation, summarization, and workflow ‚Äî not to store or process patient-identifiable information.

To use Goose responsibly:

Always use temporary chats or incognito sessions to ensure no long-term memory or retention of patient data.

Never include names, NHIs, dates of birth, contact details, or identifiable features unless you are in a secure, offline environment.

Prefer using de-identified text, or use Goose‚Äôs c/ command to sanitize clinical notes before sharing or discussing.

Always review, edit, and confirm AI-generated outputs before entering them into a patient‚Äôs clinical record.


Goose does not store or access patient records. It functions as a temporary, session-based copilot, designed to be safe, fast, and compliant when used within standard medical privacy guidelines.

Responsible Use of Summarization (s/)

The s/ command is designed to help clinicians triage and navigate clinical documents more efficiently. It is not intended as a replacement for reading the full content of critical documents. In overloaded inbox environments, clinicians frequently skim ‚Äî Goose provides a structured, faster way to surface key insights and prioritize reading. In complex, unfamiliar, or high-risk cases, the full document should always be reviewed.

This tool supports clinical judgment ‚Äî it does not substitute for it.
