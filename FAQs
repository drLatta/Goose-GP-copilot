Goose GP Copilot – FAQ

1. What is Goose?

Goose is a modular, prompt-based AI copilot designed to help general practitioners streamline documentation, referrals, patient communication, and summarization — without replacing clinical decision-making.


---

2. Is Goose a medical device?

No. Goose is not a regulated medical device. It is a productivity tool based on language model prompts. It is designed to assist — not direct — clinical work.


---

3. Can Goose make clinical decisions?

No. Goose never makes diagnoses or initiates treatment. It helps clinicians think, write, and organize — the final decision is always the GP’s responsibility.


---

4. Can I use real patient data with Goose?

Only if de-identified. Goose is designed for use in temporary or no-memory environments, and the c/ command is provided to help strip identifiable content from clinical text.


---

5. Does this replace my EMR?

No. Goose is not an EMR. It is a layer of structured support for writing, summarizing, and communicating within or alongside your existing system.


---

6. Who created Goose?

Dr. Andrea Lattarulo — a frontline GP based in New Zealand with a background in military medicine and a passion for AI-enhanced clinical workflows.


---

7. How accurate is Goose?

Goose is highly accurate for structured outputs (e.g., notes, summaries, comms), but it does not replace clinical judgment. Every output must be reviewed before use.


---

8. Has Goose been validated?

Goose is currently in real-world clinical use and undergoing feasibility evaluation. An observational study is in preparation to assess its impact on workload, accuracy, and clinician experience.


---

9. Can I contribute or fork the project?

Yes. Goose is licensed under the MIT License — free to use, modify, and build upon. Attribution must be retained and the license must remain with all versions.


---

10. Why is it called "Goose"?

A nod to the Top Gun copilot — because no GP should fly solo. Goose is your wingman: fast, reliable, sharp, and never burnout-prone.


---

11: Is Goose its own AI or language model?

No. Goose is not an AI in itself. It’s a modular system of prompts and interaction patterns designed to run on top of large language models like GPT-4, structured to support real GPs in real clinic work.
