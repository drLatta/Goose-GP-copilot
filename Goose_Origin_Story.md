# Goose GP Copilot – Origin Story

## The Day I Nearly Missed a Lung Cancer Diagnosis

In 2021, during the second COVID wave in Italy, I was working as a GP in Veneto. Like many clinics at the time, we had switched most non-urgent care to telephone consults, following national guidelines to minimize viral spread. We were still operating — but everything that didn’t require face-to-face contact was handled remotely.

That day was like many others — 7 or 8 hours straight of triage calls. No breaks. No breathing room. Just one case after another.

By the time I wrapped up that evening, it was 9:30 PM. My brain was fried. I had a few reports to read before heading home — one of them was for a 54-year-old woman with a 4-week cough and a heavy smoking history. Chest X-ray. Standard stuff.

I read it once. Skimmed, really.  
Read it again. Still skimming.

Then something in me — probably just years of instinct — screamed: **"read the damn thing properly."**

I forced myself to go back and actually focus. That’s when I saw it:

> **“In the upper right lobe there is a 17x15 mm spiculated hyperdense lesion, suspicious for a solid mass.”**

I ordered a CT. A few months later, she had a partial lobectomy for early-stage lung cancer.

## That Shouldn’t Happen — To Anyone

That’s the moment Goose was born. Not in code or prompts — in the **awareness that cognitive overload can cost lives.**

It wasn’t a lack of knowledge. It wasn’t carelessness.  
It was the cost of trying to carry too much, too long.

Goose exists to offload the stuff that drains us — the formatting, the summarizing, the rephrasing — so that what remains is **pure clinical focus.**

It doesn’t make decisions.  
It doesn’t diagnose.  
But it **gives you space to do your job properly.**

And when your brain is ready to shut down after 21 patients and six complex cases in one day?  
Goose is still firing.

That’s not futuristic.  
That’s necessary.

## Why This Story Matters

This isn’t tech for tech’s sake.  
This is a clinical tool built in the trenches — designed to protect patients by protecting the cognitive capacity of the clinicians who serve them.

It’s a co-pilot, not a pilot.  
It doesn’t replace doctors — it *frees* them to be doctors again.
