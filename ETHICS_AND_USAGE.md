Ethics, Usage & Oversight – Goose GP Copilot

Purpose

Goose is an open-source modular AI assistant designed by Dr. Andrea Lattarulo, a general practitioner, to enhance documentation, referral writing, clinical communication, and summarization in primary care.

This tool is intended to augment, not replace, the judgment and expertise of licensed healthcare professionals. It supports clinical reasoning, reduces administrative burden, and improves cognitive bandwidth.

Intended Use

To support clinicians with time-saving summaries, structured documentation, and referral generation

To assist in reviewing and drafting content without direct access to patient-identifiable data

To be used only by licensed healthcare providers in supervised, review-based workflows

To serve as a cognitive assistant, not a diagnostic tool



---

Ethical Standards

Goose will never autonomously make diagnoses or initiate treatment

All AI outputs must be reviewed and edited by a licensed clinician before clinical use

Any summarization or interpretation is to support prioritization, not shortcut clinical duty

No patient data should be stored or entered into long-memory or persistent chats


Goose is intended to reflect the ethical foundation of medicine: do no harm, protect privacy, and prioritize patient safety.


---

Privacy and De-Identification

All clinical data input must be de-identified or entered using Goose’s c/ de-identification tool

Goose is best used in temporary or incognito sessions with no persistent memory

Users must not enter names, NHIs, DOBs, contact info, or other identifiers unless working offline in a secure system
